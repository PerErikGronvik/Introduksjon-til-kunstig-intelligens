Core concepts

Probability

How likely something is to happen.

𝑃
(
𝐻
)
=
number of ways it can happen
total number of outcomes
P(H)=
total number of outcomes
number of ways it can happen
	​


Example: Coin flipping → 
𝑃
(
𝐻
)
=
½
=
0.5
=
50
%
P(H)=½=0.5=50%

Example: Rolling a die → Probability of rolling 1 or 6.

Uses of Probability
Used to analyze likelihood and uncertainty.

Statistics

Branch of mathematics dealing with data collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation.
Example dataset: Titanic dataset

Most passengers boarded at Southampton (S).

60% of passengers who boarded at Southampton died.

60% who boarded at Cherbourg (C) survived.

Almost all males from Queenstown (Q) died.

Few females from Queenstown (Q), most survived.

Visualization

Scatter plots used to visualize relationships between variables.

What is Machine Learning

Application of AI that allows systems to automatically learn and improve from experience without explicit programming.

Uses of Machine Learning

Example: Search for cats on Google

Collect many labeled examples (“cat”).

Algorithm detects patterns of pixels and colors.

Model guesses, humans adjust errors.

Model improves and predicts correctly over time.

Building an ML algorithm

Collect data

Label data

Train the model — learn patterns

Test the model — evaluate predictions

Typical ML Flow

Data → Model → Training → Evaluation → Prediction

Types of Machine Learning

Supervised learning

Unsupervised learning

Reinforcement learning

Recommender systems

Reinforcement Learning

Agent learns by interacting with environment via trial and error.

Feedback system: reward if correct, penalty if wrong.

Challenges:

Building simulation environments.

Scaling neural networks.

Limited communication except via rewards.

Example: OpenAI agents optimizing rewards without completing tasks.

Atari examples:

Breakout game: performance improves after 15 and 30 minutes of training.

Assault game: similar improvement after iterative training.

Try reinforcement learning in games: OpenAI Gym

Recommender Systems

Suggest relevant items to users.

Predict products most likely to interest or be purchased by users.

When to use Machine Learning

When rules are not explicitly known, but patterns can be inferred from data.
