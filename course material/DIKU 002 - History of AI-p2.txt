The Birth of Artificial Intelligence

1956 – Dartmouth Conference:
The founding fathers of AI:
John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Claude Shannon, Ray Solomonoff, Alan Newell, Herbert Simon, Arthur Samuel, Oliver Selfridge, Nathaniel Rochester, Trenchard More.

“We propose that a two-month, ten-man study of artificial intelligence be carried out during the summer of 1956 at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire.
An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language, form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and improve themselves.
We think that a significant advance can be made in one or more of these problems if a carefully selected group of scientists work on it together for a summer.”

The First Attempts in AI

SNARC (Stochastic Neural Analog Reinforcement Computer)

First neural network machine.

Developed by Marvin Minsky in 1951.

Contained about 40 “neurons.”

In the real world, AI innovation started in the 1950s.
Hardware and software continued evolving, sometimes inspired by biology and sometimes by psychology.

Logic Theorist (1956)

Regarded as the first AI software.

Designed to operate on symbols rather than numbers.

Demonstrated symbol manipulation as a model for human reasoning.

Proved 38 of the first 52 theorems of Principia Mathematica.

Developed by Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon.

Rosenblatt’s Perceptron

Developed by Frank Rosenblatt.

An electronic device following biological principles, capable of learning.

Model: inputs → weights → activation function → output.

Represented one of the earliest examples of machine learning based on neural computation.

Alexey G. Ivakhnenko and Multilayered Neural Networks

Developed early versions of deep learning models in the 1960s.

Proposed the use of multiple hidden layers for hierarchical learning.

Laid the groundwork for later developments in multilayer perceptrons.
